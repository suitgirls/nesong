        <h1>Neona Song's Biography</h1>
        <p>
            I am Neona Yuqiao Song and I am class of 2025 from Hermosa Beach, California.

            I decided to take this class as I wanted to learn and be more familiar with information technology. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I don't have any specific interests in technology, I'd like to learn more about IT as a whole. Outside of school I play games, paint, and occasionally read novels. I have two younger brothers and when I was 10 I called the police on Derek (he was 6 at the time) for taking my piggy bank that I borrowed from him.

            When I first got my driver's permit, I hit a pole. Not really. There are metal wires holding up the electric pole and my bumper and tire got stuck with the wire since I turned to tight. Long story short, my bumper was basically ripped off and now its nailed back on!
