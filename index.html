   I am Neona Yuqiao Song and I am class of 2025 from Hermosa Beach, California. I decided to take this class as I wanted to learn and be more familiar with information technology. I don't have any specific interests in technology, I'd like to learn more about IT as a whole. Outside of school I play games, paint, and occasionally read novels. I have two younger brothers and when I was 10 I called the police on Derek (he was 6 at the time) for taking my piggy bank that I borrowed from him.
